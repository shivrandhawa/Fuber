## Problem Statement
 In Metro Vancouver there is an excess of wasted food leading to wasted money and resources.

## Project Goals & objectives
 To build a working app that promotes and encourages food waste reduction.  This web app uses the spoontacular API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) along with a list of user inputed ingredients to display a list of recipees the user is able to make.

## Gather requirements
- The app will allow users to store food items in their kitchen by scanning a QR code on their grocery.
- By scanning food items, users are provided suggestions on recipes. 
- Food kept in a userâ€™s kitchen can be organized based on food types and where in the kitchen it is stored (ie. Fridge, pantry, freezer)
